        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I’m Paul Kahl, and I’m into web programming as part of my computer science degree. I think building websites for local businesses could be a great side hobby and it just feels like a good match for what I’m studying. The idea of creating something real, useful, and online is exciting, and this portfolio will track that journey.</p>
        <p>Beyond programming, my family is what I’m all about. I have a wonderful wife and daughter who mean the world to me, and I feel lucky every day because of them. When I’m not with my family or working on code, I’m usually outdoors—whether it’s disc golf, hiking, or just exploring, nature is where I find my balance. This portfolio is where I’ll be sharing my progress and projects as I learn more and get better at web development.</p>
