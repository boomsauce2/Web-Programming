            <p>Hi, I’m Paul! I’m passionate about web programming and love combining creativity with technical skills. This portfolio reflects my journey in learning web development and highlights projects that align with my interests in disc golf and outdoor adventures.</p>
            <p>My biggest inspiration is my beautiful family—my wife, who supports me in everything I do, and my wild and wonderful daughter, who reminds me every day why I work so hard. Achieving my Computer Science degree is just one step in my journey toward building a meaningful career after I retire from the military. This website is a testament to that journey, blending dedication, growth, and love for learning.</p>
            <p>Feel free to explore my work, learn more about my projects, and reach out with feedback or questions. Thank you for visiting!</p>
