    <h1>My Web Programming Portfolio</h1>
    <p>This page serves as a portfolio for my web programming assignments and projects.</p>

<section>
    <h2>Project 1: Web Programming Portfolio</h2>
    <p>This is my introduction to my foundational skills in web programming, including HTML, CSS, and navigation links. It'll be my central portfolio where I show assignments like a contact form, a gallery, and links to my favorite websites. This project will grow as I complete additional assignments in this course.</p>

        I had a lot of fun playing with the styling this week.
