    <h1>Web Programming Terms</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>DOM (Document Object Model):</strong> Think of it as the blueprint of your website that browsers use to build the page. It’s what lets JavaScript talk to your HTML and make cool things happen—like updating content dynamically.</li>
        <li><strong>API (Application Programming Interface):</strong> Fancy name, simple concept. APIs are like the waiters of the web, delivering data between your app and a server when you ask for it.</li>
        <li><strong>Responsive Design:</strong> Making your website look good on any screen, from a widescreen monitor to your phone. It’s all about being adaptable (like a digital chameleon).</li>
        <li><strong>Semantic HTML:</strong> Using meaningful tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<article>` so your code is more readable for both humans and search engines. It’s like writing with purpose.</li>
        <li><strong>CSS Grid:</strong> The ultimate layout tool for web design. It helps you create precise, clean layouts with rows and columns—kind of like setting up the ultimate Tetris board.</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript Events:</strong> These are like action triggers for your site. A click, a scroll, or even a mouse hover can spark an event, making the site interactive and alive.</li>
        <li><strong>GitHub Pages:</strong> A free hosting service for your static websites. Think of it as your personal stage to showcase your work to the world.</li>
        <li><strong>Meta Tags:</strong> These live in the `<head>` of your HTML and tell search engines and browsers important details about your site, like its title, description, or which language it’s in.</li>
        <li><strong>Media Queries:</strong> A CSS feature that helps you style your site differently based on the size of the screen. Perfect for making your site mobile-friendly.</li>
        <li><strong>Favicon:</strong> That tiny icon you see in the browser tab for a website. It’s small but mighty—your site’s first impression in the bookmark bar.</li>
    </ul>
